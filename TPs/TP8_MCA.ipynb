    "A **stroke** occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Brain cells begin to die within minutes. Strokes can be classified into two main types: ischemic stroke, caused by a blockage in an artery, and hemorrhagic stroke, caused by a blood vessel leaking or bursting. Immediate medical attention is crucial to minimize brain damage and potential complications (see, [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113) and [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/stroke/guide/stroke-causes-risks)). \n",
